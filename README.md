## Project Overview

In today's dynamic business landscape, understanding customer behavior and optimizing service offerings is a primary goal. Knowing the intentions of your clients as a business gives insights about your next moves, driving decision-making.

The "Premium Service Enrollment Prediction" project represents an attempt to predict whether an app user will purchase the premium offer or not based on their interactions with the app.

By delving into predictive analytics, the project not only enhances understanding of customer behavior but also equips the business with actionable insights, enabling strategic optimization of service offerings and resource allocation for maximum impact in a dynamic and competitive market.

It also allows real-time inference of new customers by making predictions using the Streamlit app put there.

You can try the app using the Streamlit view from [https://premiumenrollement.streamlit.app/](https://premiumenrollement.streamlit.app/).
